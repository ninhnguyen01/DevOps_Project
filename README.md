A DevOps Engineer is a software engineer who specializes in the best practices and tools that enable the continuous delivery of software.

DevOps Engineers (usually part of a bigger DevOps team) are responsible for bridging the gap between the development and operations teams, they work closely with developers, testers, and operations staff to oversee the code releases and provide the tools required to automate and expedite the teamâ€™s time-to-market while maintaining the quality of the deliverables.
